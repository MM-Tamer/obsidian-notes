>[!NOTE] Primitive Data Types Can Not Be Null
>To enable that behavior, you must use a wrapper class. e.g: Integer.


> [!NOTE] Typing of Literals
Any literal integer number is considered to be int (4MB) not long (8MB) while any literal decimal number is considered to be double (8MB) not float (4MB).


> [!NOTE] String, Integer, Float etc.
> String is not a primitive data type but a reference data type and the same goes to all title cased class names of primitive data types.
> Integer   ||     int (primitive)
> Short     ||     short
> Long      ||     long
> Float      ||     float
> Double  ||     double
