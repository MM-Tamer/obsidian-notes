# 1. Oversimplification:
The Assumption that one or small set of factors are  solely responsible for a complex issue. While ignoring other crucial factors and dismissing the complexity of the situation.
# 2. Texas Sharpshooter:
The Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy is when you "create a target" based on where the data happens to fit, rather than considering the data as a whole or establishing a valid connection first. It’s a form of **cherry-picking data** to fit a specific argument or conclusion.
# 3. No True Scotsman:
The **No True Scotsman** fallacy is a type of _informal logical fallacy_ where someone tries to defend a generalization or universal statement by reinterpreting it to exclude counterexamples. When an example that contradicts the generalization is presented, the person simply adjusts the definition or scope of the original claim to "exclude" the counterexample, rather than addressing the contradiction directly.
### Example:

Imagine someone says, "No Scotsman puts sugar in his porridge."  
Then, someone else responds, "But my friend Angus is from Scotland, and he puts sugar in his porridge."  
The first person might reply, "Ah, well, no _true_ Scotsman would put sugar in his porridge."
In this case, the first person has moved the goalposts and redefined "Scotsman" in a way that excludes the counterexample (the person who puts sugar in their porridge), but without offering any real argument or reasoning as to why the example shouldn't count. They're just adjusting the definition of a "true Scotsman" to make their claim immune to counterarguments.

### Key Characteristics:

- **Shifting the definition**: Instead of addressing the contradiction or exception, the person changes the criteria for what qualifies as a "true" member of a group.
- **Exclusionary logic**: The fallacy works by dismissing exceptions, even if they are valid, to preserve the original claim.

### Why it's a fallacy:

The No True Scotsman fallacy doesn't actually address the validity of the original argument. Instead, it manipulates definitions to avoid counterexamples without any reasonable justification for doing so.

This fallacy is commonly used when people make absolute or overly broad statements, and when those statements are challenged by counterexamples, they change the criteria to keep the statement intact.
# 4. Stop sign:
Resorting to a statement that ends the discussion rather than providing a logical response.
# 5. Personal Incredulity:
The inability to believe in or understand an object and subsequently assuming it's false. 
# 6. Post Hoc Ergo Propter:
Linking two events together without sufficient evidence.
E.g.: Yesterday I wore my lucky socks and today I won the lottery. Therefore it must be because of my lucky socks.

# 7. Non Sequitur:
The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises provided. And it refers to a situation where the conclusion or outcome seems completely unrelated or disconnected from the evidence or argument that was presented.

# 8. Nirvana:
Rejecting a claim or proposition on the grounds that the result that follows from it is not perfect.

# 9. Appeal To Tradition:

# 10. Poisoning the well:
Preemptively attempting to defame a person or present them in a negative light in order to hurt the credibility of the opposition and at the same time lay a false claim to a moral high ground.

# 11. Slippery Slope:

Assuming that a small change might cause a hypothetical butterfly effect without proof.

# 12. Straw Man:
Distorting or misrepresenting an argument to make easier to refute or attack rather than addressing the actual argument.

# 13. Steel Man:
The opposite of a strawman fallacy. Trying to reinforce an argument to a make it unassailable.

# 14. Equivocation: (التباس)
**Equivocation** is a logical fallacy that occurs when a word or phrase is used with multiple meanings or interpretations within the same argument, causing confusion or misleading conclusions. In this fallacy, the word shifts in meaning without clarification, and the argument relies on the different meanings to make it seem more valid than it actually is.

# 15. Appeal to emotions:


# 16. Shifting the goalposts:


# 17. Style Over Substance:
Jordan Peterson basically.

# 18. False Analogy:
The **false analogy** fallacy occurs when someone makes an argument based on a comparison between two things that are not truly alike in relevant ways. In this fallacy, the analogy drawn between two situations or things is misleading because the differences between them outweigh the similarities, making the comparison invalid.
Omar Anwar basically.

# 19. Switching the burden of proof:
**Switching the burden of proof** is a logical fallacy that occurs when someone argues that the responsibility to prove a claim lies with the other person, even though they are the one making the claim. Essentially, the person making the claim refuses to support it with evidence or reasoning, and instead demands that the other party disprove it.

# 20. Special Pleading:
**Special pleading** is a logical fallacy that occurs when someone applies a double standard to a situation or argument, making an exception for their own claim without providing a valid reason for the exception. In other words, it involves arguing that a certain rule or principle should apply to everyone **except** for their specific case, without justification for why their situation should be treated differently.

### Example:

Person A: "All animals must be treated humanely and with respect."  
Person B: "But you support hunting, which harms animals."  
Person A: "Well, hunting is okay in my case because it's a tradition in my family."


# 21. Fallacy of composition:

The **fallacy of composition** occurs when someone assumes that what is true for the individual parts of a whole must also be true for the whole itself. In other words, it involves incorrectly assuming that because something is true of each part, it must be true of the entire thing. This fallacy happens when the characteristics or properties of smaller elements are inappropriately attributed to the larger entity they make up.



# 22. Fallacy of division:
When someone assumes that what is true for the whole must hold true for the individual parts.

# 23. Appeal to Authority:


# 24. Tu quoque (Appeal to hypocrisy):
The **tu quoque** fallacy, also known as the **"you too"** fallacy or **appeal to hypocrisy**, occurs when someone deflects criticism or avoids addressing an issue by pointing out that the accuser is guilty of the same thing or behaving in a similar way. Instead of addressing the argument or problem, the person shifts the focus to the hypocrisy of the accuser, implying that the criticism is invalid because the accuser is also at fault.

# 25. Appeal to ridicule:
Ridiculing the argument to harm it's credibility.

# 26. Cherry Picking:

# 27. Appeal to ignorance:
Accepting an argument due to the lack of knowledge or evidence to counter the initial argument.
# 28. Circular Reasoning:

# 29. Anecdotal Evidence:


# 30. Red Herring:
Diverting the attention from the initial argument.

# 31. False Dilemma / Black-and-white:
presenting the issue as a dichotomy of diametrically opposed alternatives with no room for nuance or complexity or grey areas.


# 32. Loaded Quesiton:

A **loaded question** is a type of logical fallacy in which a question is phrased in such a way that it presupposes something unproven or unfair, putting the person being asked in a difficult position. The question typically contains a hidden assumption, and answering it in any way seems to validate that assumption, even if it's not true.
### Example:

- "Have you stopped cheating on your exams?"



# 33. Begging The Question:





# 34. Appeal to Popularity (Bandwagon):




# 35. Sunken Cost Fallacy:



# 36. Hasty Generalization:


# 37. The Fallacy Fallacy:
Assuming that the deduction is unequivocally wrong because the argument contained a fallacy and there's no way to prove it in an alternative manner that is free of errors.
